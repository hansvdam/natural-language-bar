# Natural Language Bar
app-'navigation' using natural language.  

## What is the point of this app?

This is a fake banking app to demonstrate the Natural Language Bar.
It is **NOT** a proposal for a banking app design,
but just shows that:\n
__You can get to any screen/functionality by typing what you want in the *LangBar* below__\n
(Although for the shear purposes of demo-ing it was not feasible to give it very wide coverage of things it can handle). The interaction principle can be built into any app.
for example type:\n
- 'debit card limit to 10000'
- 'nearest ATM'
- 'transfer 60 euros to John for his birthday' (it will not execute but just propose)
- 'show my accounts'
- 'show my transactions'
- 'renew my creditcard'
- 'I want to speak to someone at the counter'

After your first request, a **â†‘** button appears, that opens a clickable interaction history.
Besides action you can also type questions like:\n
- 'what is crowdsurance?'\n
The system will then answer based on text from a scraped banking-website (using RAG).
